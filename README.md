## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the API keys successfully work together.

* It's done when both pages are visually appealing and easy to read.

* It's done when I am able to search for any movie on the first page.

* It's done when when clicking on a searched title successfully links to the secondary page.

* It's done when the secondary page provides plot summary and streaming options.

*It's done when the listed streaming options link to the movie title on the respective streaming service.
